            <h2 class="display-4">Haircuts</h2>
              <p>I cut men, women and children’s hair. Consultation is via WhatsApp before we meet. Here you can send me photos of styles that you like, your hair in its natural state or when you had it ‘done’ and loved it. This helps build a picture so I can understand you, your hair, what you want it, and me to do! You can wash your hair before I arrive, or when I get there. I will blow dry and style your hair or rough dry it but I do not do wet cuts only - your hair will fall into shape when it dries and I like to check the haircut and cut anymore that needs after it’s dried.</p>

            <b>Do I cut curly hair?</b>
            <p>YES! I love curls, and I understand they can be challenging for some. We are all unique! I will support you in embracing your curly girl. </p>
            <b>If I want colour?</b>
            <p>If you are keen to have your hair coloured as well, please let me know. The Granary is not suitable for this, but we might be able to arrange a home visit. </p>
            <b>Can you visit me at home?</b>
            <p>It is possible to arrange a home visit. If you have a suitable space and would prefer this option please get in touch. There may be additional costs to cover my time and travel.</p>
            <b>I have booked a trial for my wedding hair, what does this involve?</b>
            <p>I always like to do a trial session with my brides, to test out your hair, any product, styles and shapes with you, and look at any accessories you might be contemplating. This also gives me a clear idea of how long we might need and ensures smooth running and outcomes on the day.</p>
